# MongoDB Security Policy for Raw Data Storage

This document outlines the security policy for the `rawDataDB` database, which stores sensitive raw data. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that data is protected from unauthorized access, loss, or corruption while maintaining system integrity and availability.

---

## **Purpose**
The security policy aims to:
1. Safeguard sensitive raw data stored in the database.
2. Prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
3. Maintain data integrity and compliance with relevant security standards.

---

## **Scope**
This policy applies to:
- **Database**: `rawDataDB`
- **Collections**: All collections within the `rawDataDB`, including but not limited to `rawData`.
- **Users**: All database users, administrators, and applications interacting with the database.

## **Steps for Securing MongoDB**

### **1. Authentication and Authorization**
1. **Enable Authentication**:
   - Configure MongoDB to require authentication for all users.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     mongod --auth
     ```

2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Assign roles to users based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Example: Create a read-only user.
     ```javascript
     db.createUser({
         user: "readUser",
         pwd: "securePassword",
         roles: [{ role: "read", db: "rawDataDB" }]
     });
     ```

---

### **2. Secure Communication**
1. **Enable TLS/SSL**:
   - Configure MongoDB to use encrypted connections for data in transit.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     mongod --tlsMode requireTLS --tlsCertificateKeyFile /path/to/certificate.pem
     ```

2. **Restrict Network Access**:
   - Configure a firewall to allow access only from trusted IP addresses or VPNs.
   - Block unauthorized access to MongoDB's default port (27017).

---

### **3. Data Encryption**
1. **Enable Encryption at Rest**:
   - Use MongoDB's built-in WiredTiger encryption to secure database files.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     mongod --enableEncryption --encryptionKeyFile /path/to/keyfile
     ```

2. **Encryption Key Management**:
   - Store encryption keys securely using an external Key Management Service (KMS).

---

### **4. Backup and Recovery**
1. **Automate Backups**:
   - Schedule regular backups of the database to secure storage.
   - Use tools like MongoDB Atlas or `mongodump`.

2. **Test Recovery Procedures**:
   - Periodically verify that backups can be restored successfully.

---

### **5. Auditing and Monitoring**
1. **Enable Database Auditing**:
   - Log all access and modifications to critical data.
   - Example: Use audit logs in MongoDB Enterprise.
   
2. **Monitor Database Activity**:
   - Use monitoring tools like **MongoDB Atlas**, **Prometheus**, or **Grafana**.

3. **Set Alerts**:
   - Configure alerts for unusual activity, such as repeated failed login attempts or unexpected data deletions.

---

### **6. Retention and Purging**
1. Follow the retention policy outlined in the [Retention Policy](./README.md).
2. Use a **TTL Index** to automatically delete expired data.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     db.rawData.createIndex({ createdAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 7776000 });
     ```
3. Securely delete data that is no longer required.

---

### **7. Best Practices**
1. **Secure the MongoDB Configuration File**:
   - Restrict access to the `mongod.conf` file to authorized administrators only.

2. **Change Default Settings**:
   - Disable the localhost exception once the database is secured.

3. **Enforce Strong Passwords**:
   - Use complex and unique passwords for all database users.

4. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep MongoDB and its dependencies updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.

---

### **8. Incident Response Plan**
1. **Detection**:
   - Monitor logs and alerts to identify potential breaches or suspicious activity.
2. **Containment**:
   - Immediately restrict access to the database in the event of a threat.
3. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze audit logs to determine the source and scope of the incident.
4. **Recovery**:
   - Restore the database from a secure backup if necessary.
5. **Prevention**:
   - Update security configurations and policies to prevent future incidents.

---

## **Testing and Compliance**
1. **Test Security Measures**:
   - Perform regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Conduct penetration tests to validate the database's resilience to attacks.

2. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure the database adheres to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA).
